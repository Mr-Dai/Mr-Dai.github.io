title: Strategy for Creating Immutable Objects

1. Don't provide "setter" methods -- methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
2. Make all fields `final` and `private`.
3. Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as `final`.
   A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor `private` and construct instances in factory methods.
4. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
   - Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
   - Don't share references to mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor;
     if necessare, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects
     when necessare to avoid returning the originals in your methods.
