<h2 class="jump">Preface</h2>
<p>
	This is a cookbook for Subversion CLI usage. No useless sentence should be found here.
</p>
<p>Let's begin.</p>
<h2 class="jump">Check out a working copy</h2>

<p>
	Everything starts from getting your own working copy. Like checking out books from library,
	we use <kbd>svn checkout</kbd> to check out from repository.
</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com:9834/repos
</pre>
<p>
	Othen than <code>http</code> scheme, <code>file://</code> is also supported:
</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
# On Unix/Linux
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos
$ svn checkout file://localhost/var/svn/repos
# these two are the same

# On Windows
C:\> svn checkout file:///X:/var/svn/repos
C:\> svn checkout "file:///X|/var/svn/repos"
</pre>
<p>
	Note how we use forward slashes to represent file path in Windows, even though the native form
	should use backslashed. As for the second expression, the URL should be quoted so that the vertical
	bar wouldn't be interpreted as a pipe.
</p>
<p>
	The list is not exhaustive yet. The URL scheme supported by <code>svn checkout</code> can be listed as below:
</p>
<table class="table table-hover">
  <tr>
	<td><b>Schema</b></td>
	<td><b>Access method</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>file:///</code></td>
	<td>Direct repository access (on local disk).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>http://</code></td>
	<td>Access via WebDAV protocol to Subversion-aware Apache server.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>https://</code></td>
	<td>Same as <code>http://</code>, but with SSL encryption.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>svn://</code></td>
	<td>Access via custom protocol to an <code>svnserve</code> server.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>svn+ssh://</code></td>
	<td>Same as <code>svn://</code>, but through an SSH tunnel.</td>
  </tr>
